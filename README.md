# A simple To-Do List app
Created with React, bootstrapped with Vite. Mostly built with Typescript and SCSS, deployed with Netlify at https://philip-avdey-todo-list.netlify.app/. 
This simple app allows you to create tasks, delete them, and complete them, as well as clear everything. This was a way for me to learn CRUD and basic React tools and hooks.
